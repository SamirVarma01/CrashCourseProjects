# Alien Invasion Game
For my first Python project, I created an alien invasion game using the Pygame package. This helped me get acquainted with scripting for larger projects and managing projects that span
across several files. As it is my first project, there are a lot of comments explaining what the code is doing.

The game itself is relatively simple, similar to a classic "Space Invaders" game. The player must take on an enormous fleet of vicious aliens as they steadily approach their spaceship. 
The player controls their spaceship with the left and right arrow keys, and fires with the space bar. Destroying different colored aliens rewards the player with different amounts of 
points. Try setting your own high score, and have fun!
